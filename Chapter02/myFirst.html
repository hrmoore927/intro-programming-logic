	<p>Hi! My name is <strong>HEATHER MOORE</strong>. Let me tell you a little about myself...</p>
	<p>I am a wedding photographer, a huge fan of the Golden Girls, a Constant Reader (aka someone who has read most of Stephen King's collection), and I absolutely love going to see live music!  I'm really excited about this program and hope that it is something that I find I'm really good at.
